""" Kite is your programming copilot. Kite will try to show you the
    right information at the right time as you code to prevent you from context
    switching out of your current line of thought.

    This tutorial will teach you how to use all of Kite's core features. You
    should be able to learn everything in 5 minutes.

    If you get stuck at any point, please visit https://help.kite.com/ or file
    an issue at https://github.com/kiteco/issue-tracker.
"""


""" PYTHON TUTORIAL ============================================================

    Not writing Python? Open tutorials for other languages by running the
    following actions:

    * For Javascript, run   "Kite: Javascript Tutorial"
    * For Go, run           "Kite: Go Tutorial"
"""


""" PART 0: BEFORE WE START ====================================================

    Kite's PyCharm plugin will by default try to start the Kite backend when
    the editor first starts. You can change this behavior by opening the Kite
    plugin's settings, and changing "Start Kite at startup".

    Look for the Kite icon in the bottom right corner of PyCharm's status bar —
    It will tell you if Kite is ready and working. If the indicator is red,
    then you'll have to start the Kite Engine manually before proceeding with
    the rest of this tutorial.
"""


""" PART 1: CODE COMPLETIONS ===================================================

    Kite analyzes your code and uses machine learning to show you completions
    for what you're going to type next.

    If you have your editor configured to show autocompletions, then Kite will
    show you completions automatically as you type.

    If you don't have autocompletions on, you can press ctrl+space to request
    completions at any time.

    You can toggle autocompletions in the editor preferences under "Editor" →
    "General" → "Code Completion" and changing "Autopopup code completion".

    Look for Kite's icon on the left-hand side to see which completions are
    coming from Kite.
"""


# 1a. Name completions
#
# Kite can suggest names of symbols to use, such as names of packages or names
# of variables in scope.

# TRY IT
# ------
# • Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
# • Type "s" and select the completion for "json". (The rest of this tutorial
#   depends on you doing so!)
# • Remember to press ctrl+space if autocompletions aren't on.

import j  # <--


# 1b. Attribute completions
#
# Type a "." after a name and Kite will show you the attributes available.

# TRY IT
# ------
# • Put your cursor at the end line of the line marked with "<--".
# • Type ".", and select the completion for "dumps".
# • Remember to press ctrl+space if autocompletions aren't on.

json  # <--


# 1c. Code completions on demand
#
# Remember that you can use a keyboard shortcut at any time to request code
# completions.

# TRY IT
# ------
# • Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
# • Press ctrl+space to request code completions to see the attributes in the
#   json module.

json.  # <--


""" PART 2: FUNCTION ASSIST ====================================================

    Kite can also show you how to use a function as you're calling it in your
    code.

    If you have your editor configured to show parameter info automatically,
    then Kite will show you this information automatically as you're coding
    when it detects that your cursor is inside a function call.

    You can prevent this UI from being shown automatically in the editor
    preferences by navigating to "Editor" → "General" → "Code Completion", and
    then changing "Autopopup" under "Parameter Info".

    You can manually request function assist at any time by pressing ctrl+p.
    However, your cursor must be inside a function call for the UI to appear.

    You can hide the function assist UI by pressing escape.
"""


# 2a. Function signatures and more
#
# When you're calling a function, Kite will show you the function's signature
# to help you remember what arguments you need to pass in. It may also show you
# examples of how other developers use the function and the keyword arguments
# you can use.

# TRY IT
# ------
# • Put your cursor at the end of line marked with "<--".
# • Type "(" to start the function call, and Kite will show you how to call
#   json.dumps.
# • Remember to press ctrl+p after typing "(" if you've disabled function
#   assist from happening automatically.
#
# • Within the UI, click on the "Examples" link to see how other developers use
#   the function.
# • You can hide this information by clicking on the "Hide" link.

json.dumps  # <--


# 2b. Learning from your own code
#
# Kite will also show you signatures, example usages, and keyword arguments for
# functions that you have defined in your own code.

# TRY IT
# ------
# • Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
# • Type "(" to get assistance for your locally defined pretty_print function.
# • Remember to press ctrl+p after typing "(" if you've disabled function
#   assist from happening automatically.

def pretty_print(obj, indent=2):
    print(json.dumps(obj, indent=indent))

pretty_print(obj, indent=4)

pretty_print  # <--


# 2c. Function assist on demand
#
# Remember that you can use a keyboard shortcut at any time to view information
# about a function.

# TRY IT
# ------
# • Put your cursor between the "(" and ")" on the line marked with "<--".
# • Press ctrl+p to access function assist.

pretty_print()  # <--


""" PART 3: INSTANT DOCUMENTATION ==============================================

    Kite can also show you documentation for the symbols in your code. You can
    use the action "Kite: Docs at cursor" to view documentation for the symbol
    under your cursor.
"""


# TRY IT
# ------
# • Move your cursor over "dumps".
# • Press ctrl+shift+a.
# • Run the action "Kite: Docs at cursor".
