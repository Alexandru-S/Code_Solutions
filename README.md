A collection of coding solutions across multiple languages, built for personal growth, practice, and mastering problem-solving techniques.

## Languages & Tools
- **Python 3.8**
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **C#**

## Project Structure
Each problem has its own folder, named after the problem, and contains the corresponding solution file. For example:

Code_Solutions/
├── problem-name/
│ ├── solution.py
│ └── README.md (optional)
├── another-problem/
│ └── solution.cs
└── README.md


## Goals
- Practice and refine algorithmic thinking.
- Explore language-specific idioms and libraries.
- Prepare for coding interviews and real-world problem solving.
